# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements that are tracked and verified.

## When
After each sprint, release, incident, or important milestone.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (with owner, due date, and success criteria)
- Follow-up on previous action items
- Review of action item impact/completion rate

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Document and assign all new action items in the project backlog or issue tracker
- Review open action items from previous retros and discuss blockers to completion

## Tracking Improvements
- Add all action items to the project backlog or issue tracker with a clear owner and due date
- Include measurable success criteria for each item
- Review outstanding and completed actions in the weekly PM sync
- Measure and share the impact of completed action items at regular intervals
- Celebrate improvements and recognize individuals driving positive change

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:
- State: (open/closed)
- Impact review (after completion):

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Foster a safe space to raise concerns or ideas
- Emphasize blameless retrospectives—focus on process, not individuals
- Take small, iterative steps to improve, rather than only tackling large changes
- Share outcomes and lessons learned with the whole team/community
