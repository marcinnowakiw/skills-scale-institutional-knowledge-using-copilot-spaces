# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

This documentation set captures the project management processes, roles, and artifacts used by OctoAcme to ensure effective delivery, clear ownership, and continuous improvement.

OctoAcme follows an iterative lifecycle covering Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Continuous Improvement. The approach emphasizes delivering small, testable increments that maximize customer value, measuring outcomes to inform decisions, and preserving psychological safety for learning. Core roles include Product Managers (define outcomes and success metrics), Project Managers (coordinate delivery, risks, and communication), Developers (implement and test), QA (validate acceptance), and Stakeholders (approve and guide priority). Workflows rely on a project board pattern for status (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), small PRs linked to issues and acceptance criteria, and explicit risk/dependency tracking.

Communication and cadence are standardized so teams stay aligned: daily standups for tactical coordination, weekly PM/PdM syncs for planning and escalation, sprint demos/reviews to demonstrate value, and periodic stakeholder updates. Communication templates (weekly status, incident summaries) and a defined escalation path reduce ambiguity and speed resolution of blockers. Quality assurance is embedded: unit and integration tests, CI security scans, manual QA for acceptance when needed, pre-release smoke tests, release checklists, and rollback plans ensure safe deployments. Retrospectives capture improvements as tracked action items to continuously evolve the process.

These documents are intended to be the single entrypoint for onboarding and day-to-day use. Each linked doc contains templates, checklists, and step-by-step guidance to apply the process across projects.
